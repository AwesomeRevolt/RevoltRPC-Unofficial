## Configuration

The script reads config from environment variables defined in `.env`.  
Here's a summary of configurable options:

| Variable               | Description                                    | Default                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `USER_TOKEN`           | Your Revolt user token (required)              | —                       |
| `LASTFM_API_KEY`       | Last.fm API key for scrobbling (optional)      | —                       |
| `LASTFM_USERNAME`      | Your Last.fm username (optional)                | —                       |
| `UPDATE_INTERVAL_MS`   | Interval to update status (in milliseconds)    | 30000 (30 seconds)      |
| `ENABLE_LASTFM`        | Enable Last.fm listening status                 | true                    |
| `ENABLE_GAME_DETECTION`| Enable game detection for status                | true                    |
| `DEFAULT_STATUS_TEXT`  | Fallback status text                             | `Using RevoltRPC-Unofficial 😎`       |
| `DEFAULT_PRESENCE`     | Presence to show (`Online`, `Idle`, `Focus`, etc.)       | `Online`                |
| `STATUS_EMOJI_MUSIC`   | Emoji for music status                    | 🎧                      |
| `STATUS_EMOJI_GAME`    | Emoji for game status                     | 🎮                      |

> **⚠️ Important:**  
> Do **not** set `UPDATE_INTERVAL_MS` too low (EX; below 10 seconds) to avoid spamming the API and risking rate limits or bans. A recommended minimum is 30,000 ms (30 seconds)

## Usage

### Running the bot

Run the bot with:

```bash
npm start
```

Or in development mode (auto-restarts on code changes):

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## How it works

- On startup, the bot logs in using your Revolt token.
- It every 30s attempts to:
  - Fetch your currently playing track from Last.fm.
  - Detect any running games from a predefined games list. (Contributes are appreciated and encouraged to grow our supported game list)
- It updates your Revolt status with either:
  - Now playing music (if enabled and available).
  - Currently running game (if enabled and detected).
  - Default fallback status text.

## File Structure

```
RevoltRPC-Unofficial/
├── index.ts            # Main script
├── games.json          # List of supported games for detection
├── example.env         # Example environment variables
├── package.json        # Project config and dependencies
└── README.md           # This documentation
```

## Adding/Editing Games for Detection

The `games.json` file contains a list of games with their executable names to detect running games.  
Add your own games by editing this file:

```json
[
  { "exe": "Among Us.exe", "name": "Among Us" },
  { "exe": "Fallout4.exe", "name": "Fallout 4" }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Status does not update?**  
  Ensure your `USER_TOKEN` is correct and active.

- **Last.fm data not showing?**  
  Verify your `LASTFM_API_KEY` and `LASTFM_USERNAME` are correct.

- **Game detection not working?**  
  Add your game's executable to `games.json` and confirm the app has permissions to list processes.

- **Errors during startup?**  
  Check the console logs for errors and ensure all dependencies are installed.

- **Check Node Version**  
  The only tested node version for this project is `v22.15.0`
